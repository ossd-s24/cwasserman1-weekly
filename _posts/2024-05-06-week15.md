title: Week 14

This week’s class discussion on open source projects that were not software related was very interesting. I never have thought about how open source can be applied outside of the software world. For this assignment, I chose to look into Open Source Malaria, which works on providing an open source solution to developing a cure for malaria. Other people in the class talked about many different projects such as Open Source Pharmaceuticals, Open Source Malaria’s parent project, Open Bionics, which seeks to develop prosthetics in an open-source way, and Project Gutenberg, which is an open source library project.
This week, my group has made a lot of progress for our open source project. I successfully made and merged a PR for a code change and am now looking for other issues to take on. My group members both have working solutions for issues but have yet to be assigned the issue. Once they are assigned the issue, they are both ready to make a PR. While waiting to be assigned, they are actively looking for other issues to take on.
