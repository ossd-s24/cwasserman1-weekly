title: Week 15
---

Watching everyones’ presentations this week has been really awesome. I really enjoyed getting to see what everyone else has been working on for the whole semester and the progress they were able to make. I was particularly interested in the Godot presentation. I used to be into game development and used Unity extensively. I would love to get back into game development and would consider using and possibly contributing to Godot in the future. I also liked seeing other groups’ progress on projects that I have personally used and still use, such as FreeCodeCamp and Pandas. 
I was also happy with my group’s progress over the course of the semester. I think that things started off slow while trying to make MuseScore work. In retrospect, we should have changed projects much earlier but we sort of stubbornly tried to make it work. I think that I can take this as a learning lesson to not ignore red flags in a project down the road. However, we were able to last minute switch our project to Oppia and make some meaningful progress. I plan on continuing contributing to the project.
